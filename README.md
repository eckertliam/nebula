# Nebula

## Nebula is a work in progress

Nebula is a simple language designed from first principles for educational purposes. Nebula takes syntactic inspiration from Rust, C/C++, and TypeScript. The language semantics attempt to find a balance between the simplicity of TypeScript and the power of Rust. This means no poisoning the type system with `null` or `undefined` as well as no `unsafe` code blocks. Nebula also differs from Rust in that it is garbage collected (plans to be) and has a more flexible ownership model (no borrow checker yelling at you).
